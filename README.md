# Filter Languages And Set Defaults

A Tdarr flow plugin that removes non-native and non-english audio streams and sets the first native audio track and first english subtitle track to the defaults.

The native language of the media is provided via the Sonarr or Radarr API.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This REQUIRES you to follow the TRaSH guides naming convention by having the series TVDB id like so: [tvdbid-*id*] in the series root folder. And for movies you need the movie TMDB id in the file name like so: [tmdbid-*id*]
